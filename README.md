# React-front-end-Todo-App

This is a front-end of the todo app project. It uses the [Django REST API](https://github.com/Django-REST-FrameWork-Projects/Django-REST-api-todo-app) that I built.

### Build/Run

Before your run this project, make sure that the [backend api](https://github.com/Django-REST-FrameWork-Projects/Django-REST-api-todo-app) is running on a server.

```cd frontend```

```npm start```

This will start the project on ```http://localhost:3000/```
